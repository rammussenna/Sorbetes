#  Sorbetes: Sa Likod ng Ngiti

> _"To the ones who lived ordinary lives in extraordinary pain —  
We saw you. Even if we looked away."_

**Sorbetes: Sa Likod ng Ngiti** is a short, narrative-driven psychological horror game set in the heart of the Philippines. You play as a street-side ice cream vendor — a seemingly ordinary figure — whose past unravels slowly as the day progresses. But something’s wrong. The bells ring even when you don’t move. Children laugh, even when the streets are empty.

## Story Summary (Spoiler-Free)

You are **Mang Delfin**, a longtime sorbetero. It's just another hot afternoon — but as you go about your usual routine, things begin to feel… off.

Children no longer greet you.
The same street repeats itself.
And sometimes, you hear crying — from your own cart.
